CO2 Emission by vehicles
==============================
Project Overview
==============================
This project focuses on machine learning workflows, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling. It is divided into three main components:

**Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**
Exploration of datasets to identify trends, distributions, and anomalies.
Application of preprocessing techniques such as missing value handling, encoding, scaling, and feature selection.

**Regression Modeling:**
Implementation and evaluation of regression models to predict continuous target variables.
Includes hyperparameter tuning and performance metrics analysis.

**Classification Modeling:**
Development of classification models to categorize data into discrete classes.
Assessment of model accuracy and comparison of different approaches.
The repository provides a structured approach to building and evaluating machine learning models, showcasing best practices for reproducibility and performance optimization.
